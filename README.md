These are python code that I use to calculate my lab result. I think these will make your lives a little easier than use normal calculator.

Ps1. There are some lab that don't have to calculate much. So, I didn't write code for it.
Ps2.Some codes can be easier use if you use for and array. Modify it as you wish. I write all code after finish my lab, So,It might not much neat.
